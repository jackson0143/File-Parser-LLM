# ðŸš€ File Parser LLM using LangChain + OpenAI

This project demonstrates a simple **File Parser LLM application** that reads the contents of a file (currently for PDFs) and uses an LLM to summarise or extract information. It leverages **LangChain** with the **OpenAI API** for natural language processing. This is just a testing prototype to be used for another industry project I am working on, so it is very unfinished on this repository.

# Setting up Environment Variables
To set up your environment variables, create a .env file in the main folder and paste the following:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```
Replace your_openai_api_key_here with your actual OpenAI API key.

If you donâ€™t yet have a key, you can generate one by signing up at https://platform.openai.com.
